# Response to Mike - SAP Integration

## Suggested Response

Hey Mike,

Thanks for the info! That's really helpful context. SAP sounds like a comprehensive system for housing everything.

I'm building a quick capture tool that could serve as a structured way to take notes during calls, which you could then easily transfer into SAP. The idea is to make it faster to capture the key things you mentioned (personality, self-awareness, injuries, etc.) in a consistent format, rather than having to organize free-form notes later.

I've structured it around the three areas you mentioned:
- **Personality**: How they carry themselves, preparation level, knowledge of Portland
- **Self Awareness/Player Identity**: How they view themselves, what's important to them, mindset towards growth
- **Injuries**: Big injuries and what those periods were like

Would something like that be useful as a quick capture tool before entering into SAP? Or would you prefer I focus on something else?

Happy to show you a rough draft once I've got it working - no rush though!

## Alternative: More Collaborative Tone

Hey Mike,

Perfect, thanks for sharing! SAP sounds like a solid system for housing everything.

I'm putting together a quick capture tool structured around those three areas you mentioned - personality, self-awareness, and injuries. The idea is it could serve as a structured note-taking system during calls that makes it easy to transfer key takeaways into SAP afterward.

I've built it around your specific tracking points:
- Personality (how they carry themselves, preparation, knowledge of Portland)
- Self Awareness/Player Identity (self-view, priorities, growth mindset)
- Injuries (big ones and what those periods were like)

Would that be helpful, or would you prefer I focus on something else? Happy to show you a draft when it's ready.
