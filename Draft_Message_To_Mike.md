# Draft Message to Mike - Qualitative Capture System

## Option 1: Casual & Curious (Recommended) - SHORT VERSION

**Subject**: Quick question about call tracking

Hey Mike,

Quick question: Do you currently have a system for capturing notes from player/agent calls? I'm tinkering with a simple tool to organize qualitative data alongside our metrics, but want to understand your current workflow first.

What do you typically track from these calls, and is there anything about your current process that's a pain point?

Thanks!

## Option 2: More Direct (If you want to be more specific)

**Subject**: Call logging system - quick question

Hi Mike,

As you start making calls with players and agents, I'm curious about how you currently track those conversations.

Do you have a system for logging:
- Player personality/character assessments
- Agent impressions and professionalism
- Red flags or concerns
- Key talking points and timelines
- Overall recommendations

I'm working on a simple tool to help capture this qualitative information in a structured way, but I want to make sure it aligns with what you actually need. What does your current process look like, and what would make it easier/better?

Happy to show you a rough draft once I have a better sense of your needs.

## Option 3: Very Casual / Low Pressure

**Subject**: Quick workflow question

Hey Mike,

Quick question: when you're doing player/agent calls, how do you typically keep track of notes and impressions? Just curious about your current process.

I'm playing around with a simple way to organize that kind of qualitative data, but want to make sure I'm building something that would actually be useful rather than just adding complexity.

What information do you find yourself wanting to capture from those conversations?

## Option 4: Problem-Focused (Best for gathering pain points)

**Subject**: Call notes tracking - what's your current process?

Hi Mike,

Quick question about your workflow: when you're doing player and agent calls, how do you currently track and organize your notes?

I'm thinking about ways we could better capture the qualitative side of scouting (personality, character, agent relationships, etc.) alongside all the quantitative data we've been building. But I want to understand your current process first - what works, what doesn't, and what information you find yourself needing to reference later.

Do you have a system in place, or is it more ad-hoc? What would make this part of the process easier for you?

## Key Elements to Include (Mix & Match)

### Opening
- ✅ Casual, friendly tone
- ✅ Frame as curiosity about his process
- ✅ Reference the upcoming calls naturally

### Information Gathering Questions
- ✅ "Do you currently have a system/process for...?"
- ✅ "What information do you typically track?"
- ✅ "What does your current process look like?"
- ✅ "What would make it easier/better?"
- ✅ "What works / what doesn't?"

### Teasing Your Work (Keep Vague)
- ✅ "I'm tinkering with / playing around with / working on..."
- ✅ "A simple tool / way to organize..."
- ✅ "Might help / could help..."
- ✅ "No promises / rough draft / early stages"

### Closing
- ✅ Invite him to share his needs
- ✅ Offer to show a draft (but don't commit to timeline)
- ✅ Keep it collaborative, not prescriptive

---

## What NOT to Say (Keep Expectations Low)

❌ "I've built a complete system"
❌ "This will solve all your problems"
❌ "It's ready to use"
❌ "Here's what I've created"
❌ Overly technical details
❌ Promises about features or timeline

## Recommended Approach

**Use Option 1** - It's:
- Casual and friendly
- Asks open-ended questions
- Hints at a solution without overpromising
- Invites collaboration
- Keeps expectations realistic

**Then follow up based on his response:**
- If he has a system → Ask what works/doesn't work
- If he doesn't → Ask what he wishes he could track
- If he's interested → Show him the app (but frame as "rough draft")
- If he's not interested → No pressure, just wanted to check

## Sample Follow-Up (If He Responds Positively)

"Thanks for the info! Based on what you shared, I've put together a rough draft of something that might help. It's still pretty basic, but I'd love to get your thoughts on whether it's heading in the right direction. Happy to show you whenever you have a few minutes - no rush!"

---

## Sample Follow-Up (If He Already Has a System)

"That's helpful context - thanks! If you're open to it, I'd love to see what you're currently using. I'm curious if there's a way to integrate qualitative call data with our quantitative player metrics, but want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel or adding unnecessary complexity."
