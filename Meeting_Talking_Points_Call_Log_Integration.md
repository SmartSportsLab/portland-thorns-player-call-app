### **Player Overview Pages → Enhanced with Call Data**
- Overview pages show: metrics, charts, scatterplots, comparisons
- Call log adds: personality, communication, cultural fit, injury history
- **Result:** Complete 360-degree view of each player

### **Scouting Packages → Informed Decision-Making**
- Final packages (Top 15 per position) include: quantitative rankings + qualitative assessments + complete profiles

## Q&A Preparation

**Q: Why not just use SAP?**  
A: SAP excels at player management/compliance but isn't designed for nuanced qualitative scouting assessment. Our app captures scouting-specific insights.

**Q: How does it integrate with our data?**  
A: Directly connects to player database, auto-populates from shortlists, exports data complementing overview pages and scouting packages.

**Q: Can we use both?**  
A: Absolutely. They complement each other: SAP for official management, our app for scouting intelligence.

**Q: What if SAP adds scouting features?**  
A: Our app is purpose-built for our specific workflow and integrates directly with our data. We can customize it instantly based on feedback, unlike waiting for vendor updates. Plus, it's free and we own the data.

**Q: Isn't this redundant?**  
A: No—they capture different data. SAP tracks official records; our app captures scouting intelligence. Like having both a CRM (SAP) and a scouting notebook (our app)—both essential but different purposes.

**Q: How do we avoid duplicate data entry?**  
A: Our app auto-populates from our database, reducing manual entry. We can export structured data to import into SAP, or use SAP for official records and our app for scouting notes—they serve different purposes.

**Q: What about data security?**  
A: Our app runs on Streamlit Cloud with secure authentication. We control access and can add additional security measures as needed. Data stays within our ecosystem.

**Q: Can we integrate them technically?**  
A: Yes—our app exports CSV/PDF that can be imported into SAP. We can also build API connections if needed. The structured data format makes integration straightforward.
